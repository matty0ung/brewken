/**
 * \brief Templated base class for \c Mash, \c Boil and \c Fermentation to handle manipulation of their component steps
 *        (\c MashStep, \c BoilStep and \c FermentationStep respectively).
 *
 *        In BeerJSON, the step owner types have overlapping sets of fields, which correspond to our properties as
 *        follows (where ‡ means a field is required and * means Mash/Boil/Fermentation as appropriate):
 *

 *           -----------------     -----------------     -------------------------  |  --------

 *                               ‡ boil_time                                        |          Boil::boilTime_mins
 *         ‡ mash_steps                                                             |          Mash::mashSteps
 *                                 boil_steps                                       |          Boil::boilSteps
 *                                                     ‡ fermentation_steps         |  Fermentation::fermentationSteps
 *
 *        We don't do this as a subclass of \c NamedEntity, because the only common property in \c Mash, \c Boil and
 *        \c Fermentation (apart from the ones they get from \c NamedEntity is the \c notes field.  What we want is
 *        something that will handle all the logic of step addition, removal, reordering etc, and ideally do so in a
 *        strongly-typed way (eg so that it is never possible to add a \c BoilStep to a \c Mash!)  Hence this templated
 *        class.
 *
 *        As noted elsewhere in the code base, the Qt meta object compiler (moc) can't handle templated classes, but it
 *        can ignore them.  So we need to use multiple inheritance to use a templated base class, and to ensure that the
 *        templated base class is not the first thing inherited from.  (In fact, the requirement is stronger: the base
 *        class inheriting from \c QObject must be the first in the inheritance list.)
 *
 *        We also use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) to allow this base class to easily access members
 *        of the derived class.
 *
 *        We assume/require that \c DerivedStep inherits from \c Step.
 *
 *        Note that we do \b not inherit from \c CuriouslyRecurringTemplateBase because \c SteppedOwnerBase already does
 *        this.  If we inherited again, we'd end up with two (identical) implementations of this->derived() that the
 *        compiler can't disambiguate between.
