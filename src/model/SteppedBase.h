/**
 * \brief This CRTP base class provides "step-like" behaviour to classes that inherit from it.
 *
 *        For various reasons, including because it's the term used in BeerXML and BeerJSON, when we talk about a
 *        "step", we usually mean a \c MashStep, \c BoilStep or \c FermentationStep.  We use \c Step and \c StepBase to
 *        model the common behaviours and attributes of these three concrete classes.  However, \c Instruction also has
 *        some step-like behaviours and attributes that it shares with \c Step subclasses:
 *          - Each \c Instruction has an owner (a \c Recipe)
 *          - An \c Instruction has no independent existence of its owner (deleting a \c Recipe implies deleting all the
 *            corresponding \c Instruction objects).
 *          - The \c Instruction objects belonging to a given \c Recipe have an ordering
 *
 *        So we pull out these more fundamental properties into \c SteppedBase and \c SteppedOwnerBase, as the following
 *        \b partial inheritance diagram shows:
 *
 *                          SteppedBase                                      SteppedOwnerBase
 *                          /         \                                       /           \
 *                    StepBase       Instruction                       StepOwnerBase     Recipe
 *                    /   |   \                                          /   |   \
 *                   /    |    \                                        /    |    \
 *                  /     |     \                                      /     |     \
 *          MashStep  BoilStep  FermentationStep                    Mash   Boil    Fermentation
 *
 *        This gives enough of what we need, for now.  We would need to rethink a bit if we had one type of object
 *        owning more than one type of "steps".
 *
 *        NOTE that the "stepped" concept does not apply to other things "owned" by Recipe, such as \c RecipeAdditionHop
 *        or \c BrewNote, because they do not have the same need of pure ordering.  There is an implicit ordering by
 *        addition time or date, but it is not necessary or desirable to be more precise than this.  You will often have
 *        two hop additions that happen at the same time, for instance.
 *
 *        Directly derived classes need to include STEPPED_COMMON_DECL and STEPPED_COMMON_CODE in the obvious places
 *        (either their own macros for \c StepBase or in the header and implementation file respectively for
 *        \c Instruction).

/**
 * \brief Concrete derived classes should (either directly or via inclusion in an intermediate class's equivalent macro)

 *        following block (see comment in model/StepBase.h for why):
 *
 *           // See model/SteppedBase.h for info, getters and setters for these properties
 *           Q_PROPERTY(int ownerId      READ ownerId      WRITE setOwnerId   )
 *           Q_PROPERTY(int stepNumber   READ stepNumber   WRITE setStepNumber)
 *
 *        Comments for these properties:
 *
 *           \c ownerId : ID of the owning object - eg \c Mash, \c Boil, \c Fermentation, \c Recipe
 *
 *           \c stepNumber : The step number (starting from 1) in a sequence of other steps.
 *
 *        Although we could do more in this macro, we limit it to member functions that are just wrappers around calls
 *        to this base class.
 *
 *        Note we have to be careful about comment formats in macro definitions.
 *
 *        In older versions of Qt, we didn't used to be able to put Q_PROPERTY inside our own macro, but, thankfully,
 *        the Qt MOC (meta object compiler) now expands "normal" macros before processing its own "special" ones.
